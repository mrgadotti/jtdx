// Ported from CE3TSK's jtdx_contest (https://github.com/ce3tsk/jtdx_contest).
// Which Tx message answers a decoded message addressed to me (double click on a line,
// MainWindow::processMessage). The message's last field decides:
//   RRR / RR73 / 73        -> Tx5, sign off
//   R<report> or "R"       -> Tx4, RR73
//   a report               -> Tx3, roger report
//   a grid                 -> Tx2 in normal operation (send my report)
//                             Tx3 in the WW Digi contest: the grid *is* his exchange, so the answer
//                             is "HISCALL MYCALL R MYGRID" - the same as the auto-sequencer sends.
//                             Tx2 there would repeat a bare "HISCALL MYCALL MYGRID" without the R,
//                             i.e. behave as if I had called him (seen on air 2026-08-29).
//   nothing after his call -> Tx2
// hasLast: a field follows his call; last: that field; lastIsGrid: it passes gridOK().
