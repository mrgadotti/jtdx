/* Ported from CE3TSK's jtdx_contest (https://github.com/ce3tsk/jtdx_contest).

   WW Digi contest - stations to leave alone for a while.

   The contest exchange is the 4 character grid. A station that answers our exchange with a
   signal report ("CE3TSK DL6FKR -10", "CE3TSK DL6FKR R-10") is running ordinary FT8/FT4, not
   the contest: the QSO cannot complete, because neither side ever sends what the other is
   waiting for. Answering him again the next period only repeats the deadlock, and the
   autoselect would do exactly that - he is calling us, which is the highest priority there
   is. So the QSO is dropped and he is skipped for five minutes.

   Keyed by base callsign. A double click on the station clears him again - the operator
   overrules this. A clock that jumps backwards keeps a station ignored rather than releasing
   him early; five minutes later he is free either way. */
